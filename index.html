      <p>
        I'm originally at the receiving end, and I'm very happy that Alan gave
        me this opportunity. So, I'm studying with the University of
        Brigham-Yam, from the United States. You could say I'm studying
        full-time, but I really take a lot of workload, and I'm working as well.
        I'm actually an accountant, but I've found that I actually enjoy social
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, in three terms, I do study and I develop also. So, as part of my
        last year in university, they wanted me to basically build an
        application. But then, it can be just something that I come up with and
        run it your way. I have to do for a client, and then actually see the
        client and figure out what we're going to build. So, part of that, being
        an accountant, I know the trouble that comes with profiling stock
        costing and tracking inventory and descriptors with inventory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The companies that I work for, pretty much, we all have that problem. As
        an accountant, you have to wait for the end, for the month to end,
        because my family here reports me at the end of the month. And they
        usually have big discrepancies with that. So, I realize, hey, there's
        probably a couple of more companies that might be having the same
        problem. So, I've tried a small, you could say, medium-sized,
        small-sized medium-sized wholesaler. And, you know, he showed interest
        in something that can help check his stock in real time. So, for that,
        that's what I just went and ran with.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, I came up with an idea to build a stock management
        application. That uses, I don't know if you know what it's by full, that
        it's based in FESTA. And that's basically the application that I built.
        So, for the back end, I went with TypeScript. I think there's someone
        else that said they love TypeScript over there. I just went with
        TypeScript, like, it's the work. And so, I built that with TypeScript.
        Then, for the database management, I went with MobileDB. The structure
        that, you know, the relationship with data on MobileDB is very... It
        allows you to play around with it a lot. Rather than using SQL as I went
        with MobileDB, I would basically have a document that has a relationship
        embedded within it. Almost like I have an object, and then for all of
        the properties, it can be an array that I inject into that array. So,
        that's what I went with.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is basically that the deck ends. And the biggest thing for me
        when I was coming up with this was at my focal point that we go around
        four things. The first one was to increase stock accuracy. So instead of
        waiting by the end of the month when you get your stock, to know what
        really happened throughout the month, the manager would rather want to
        know what is happening with this stock throughout the whole month. You
        know, rather than waiting on the month. And so my focal point was to
        increase stock accuracy by 95%. Then reduce the discrepancy between the
        reported stock and the physical count. They're still going to counter
        the end of the month, but you still want to reduce that much so that you
        don't end up having 20 cases missing. You have a case, you can sort of
        write that off, but you can't write 20 cases off. That's very expensive.
        So as an end result, I said, you know, let's work with something that
        can, you can see what's happening as time is moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the second focal point for me was the reduction of stock hours.
        Last year I remember one of the biggest, not actually last year, when
        they probably started, our company ran out of sanitizers. And I think
        I'm going to talk to this, this is a client that they also have put in
        stock out. So if you can actually see your stock as the month is going
        through, you can actually assess which ones are likely to run out before
        they run out. And then you can avoid having people to basically place
        order for stock that is about to run out. So that was the other focal
        point. So that is to decrease the period of stock hours by 20%. Then
        obviously that is also going to help with your customer rotation.
        Because if customers are happy, they get their product on demand, or
        they're coming back for sure. Rather than having to pay and wait for two
        months and to get their stock and stuff like that.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then the third one was enhance inventory turnover. So when you can
        see which stock is really running through your stock reports. It's
        really easy to see, okay, let's focus on maybe the toothpaste or this
        and that rather than having a big catalog then the rest of the products
        get written off. And you're stuck with a product that you can't move.
        So, enhanced inventory turnover was also one of my focal points. And
        then the last one was obviously the time. So we don't want to waste
        time. The manager is also going to be using the application, so I was
        thinking, hey, I'm just going to build an app, stick it in the app
        store, and be done with it. But then I realized it's going to be a bit
        complicated than that.
      </p>

      <p>
        So in the application, I also included a quick calculator. It can show
        you if you have to calculate your stock and you can do it manually or do
        it within the application and it actually helps you out with that as
        well. So, for me, that's my 20% of experience. And then, you know, it
        was a lot of sleepless nights. And actually, this project was not really
        about even my university. It was something that I was actually testing
        on the side and seeing if it can work. And then I saw an opportunity
        that this could be my final project. So for my final project, I went
        through a couple of challenges, like maybe even today, one of the
        biggest challenges I've seen as I was going through this is, first of
        all, I had a little bit of Imposter Syndrome, because I was basically
        playing around with coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was playing with coding a lot, and I hadn't actually built a full
        project. So, when I was sitting down, I was like, okay, fine, I'm
        building a stock application. But what is this actually for? So, I
        didn't really see the endpoint. But as I was going through it, I
        realized, okay, this is helping me a lot. And it's helping me understand
        exactly what is going on in the field, and what problems are there. And
        so, as I was building the application, I realized, hey, this can
        actually help the manager as well. So then it became not just a
        university project, but it became something that I felt would help me.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, as I was going through it, the challenges that I faced was basically
        the backend, because I'm still studying. And I thought, hey, I'm going
        to build an application, just for a couple of screens. But then I
        realized, you know, I'm going to need a server as well, because you're
        going to be moving a lot of data in real time. So, you know, the backend
        became a challenge. But then, as I was going through it, I realized,
        okay, fine, the backend is a challenge. But then, if I stick to
        JavaScript or TypeScript, then the frontend can also become a bit of a
        challenge, because it has to connect with the backend. So, I went
        through a lot of things, like you know, connecting with a server. And
        then I had to build a server. And then I had to have the frontend that
        can actually connect with the server. And then as I was going through
        it, I realized, okay, the biggest problem I was having was real-time
        data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because I'm dealing with an application that has to basically track the
        stock in real-time, and you can't be clicking refresh every time to see
        if your stock has moved. So, real-time data, I realized, was my biggest
        challenge. So then, in my research, and also I got a couple of guys that
        came on board with me, like, hey, I'm building an application. And
        they're like, hey, okay, I'll help you out. So, we're also going through
        it, and we're like, okay, fine. So, real-time data was my biggest
        challenge. So, we started researching and seeing, okay, how can we solve
        this problem? And then, yeah, that was basically it for me.
